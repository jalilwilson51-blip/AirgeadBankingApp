Airgead Banking Investment Application

Summary

The Airgead Banking Investment Application is a console implementation in C++ that assists the user in visually comparing how their money can grow today over time just by making an initial investment due to compound interest. The user inputs aggregate investing amounts, monthly plans of contribution, projected annual percentage yield and expected length of time an investment would otherwise remain risky/unaccessible. Two formatted tables of investment are generated based on the following: • Without Monthly Deposits • With Monthly Deposits. This project demonstrates my abilities as a skilled C++ code developer with a clean code, an understanding of OOP and a resulting project that is user-friendly, fully functional and compliant with industry standards.

Where It Came From

This was a conceptual project that took a real-life scenario bank application through which any user could attempt to create the projections for such long term savings strategies via not using/using multiple savings through a month potential. It solves the problem of figuring out what balance can be achieved in the future by providing the following: • Realized projections based on user input financials • Compound interest calculated for the annual gain • Monthly deposits assessed to create output characterized branch conditions. Therefore, with the use of my project, someone could avoid the manual calculations and see the results in a more projected table.

What I Did Well

I feel I succeeded with the following: • Modular program with a separate header, implementation and main files • Compound interest exportable functions that could be reused • Professional formatted output tables with great visibility. • Great readability with logic flow and well-commented code for maintenance ease.

What I Could Do Better

While the program runs effectively and meets requirements, there are always improvements to be made. Given more time, I would implement the following: • Input Check Improvements—Stronger error checks to avoid bad inputs. • File Exports—Ability for tables to export as .csv files would allow easy access to creations to share. • Class Design Horizontal Layout—A class hierarchy would allow easier scalability should they want multiple investments or different interests but decided to use their own fields.

These improvements would make it faster, safer, and more accommodating for future endeavors.

What Was Most Difficult

The hardest part of this project was ensuring that the compound interest formula was accurately and correctly applied and that deposits/rollover occurred correctly over various years. I achieved this by taking each area of the compound interest formula piece by piece to ensure each component was justified, comparing my successful calculations with known successes and referencing class notes from this course and other courses over the years, C++ documentation and Stack Overflow for clarification.

What Skills Were Transferred

This project nurtured many transferable skills that could be used in future classes, personal projects and professional software development, including: • C++ Programming & OOP: Modular, reusable functions promote efficiency • Financial Applications: The ability to apply a mathematical formula to create real-world projections is huge and can be applied all the time • Debugging: Continuous verification through output was necessary for accuracy • Professional Coding practices: Knowing how to code for other maintainers is important in a large development team.

Program Readability/Maintainability/Extensibility

To ensure my program is maintainable, readable and extensible, I: • Implemented naming conventions that consistent meaning throughout the program. All variables have good names to avoid confusion. • Used logical principles that divide tasks into smaller functions that operate well despite division. • Commented in-line as well as functional description paragraphs for function purpose and logic of operation. • Included extensible logic all around to ensure additional features could easily be added.
